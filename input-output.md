## JavaScript Interview Question

### Question 1: What will be the output?

```js
var a = "xyz";
var a = "par";
console.log(a);
```

### Answer:

**Output:** `"par"`

**Reason:**  
Both the variables are declared using the `var` keyword with the same name `"a"`. The second variable declaration overrides the first one.
